# ChatPDF
ChatPDF is an AI-powered app that allows users to upload or link to a PDF file and start asking it questsions related to the PDF. Learn more about this product [here](https://www.chatpdf.com/). ChatPDF offers an API that allows for integrating its service into a Skuid app. In this sample page, the end user can provide a URL to a PDF and start chatting with ChatGPT about that document. 

## Connect to ChatPDF API
Follow the steps from [ChatDPF API Documentation](https://www.chatpdf.com/docs/api/backend) to generate an API key. 

## Create a Skuid data source
In your Skuid site, configure a data source with these properties:

- **Name**: ChatPDF
- **Data Source Type**: REST
- **URL**: ``https://api.chatpdf.com``
- **Authentication Method**: No Authentication
- **Use (Apex) Proxy**: Checked

Append the following key-value pair in the **Common Request Parameters** section:

- x-api-key: ``<paste your API key here>``

If you are using Skuid SFX (our Salesforce managed package), you will be prompted to create a Remote Site Setting. Accept the prompt, or you'll need to create one manually.

## Import Design System
Download this [Design System file](../openAI/ChatGPT_Demo.designsystem?raw=true) and use the Import function on the Design System page to add this system to your org. 

## Import Skuid page
- Page API:  V2
- Page XML:  [Copy the XML from this page](chatPDF.xml?raw=true), or save it as an XML file, and upload it as a new page in Skuid's pages list.

## How does it work?
In the Skuid page, after user submits a URL, it'll send the URL to ChatPDF API which then returns an id to reference for the chat session. See [this doc](../openAI/draftAnswers/Readme.MD) that explains the configuration for chatGPT interface in Skuid.

## Notes
In the page composer, if you see this error `Error retrieving metadata for model(s) associated with data source 'ChatPDF'. Please check models' properties to ensure they are set correctly. Error connecting to REST data source at URL "https://api.chatpdf.com/v1/sources/add-url": Could not read PDF`, you can safely dismiss it as it's related to the metadata call we make automatically on REST models.

ChatPDF has a few limitations: 
- Only supports chat with one PDF at a time. However - Skuid could potentially provide a single frontend experience that submits a request to multiple PDF chat bots.
- Can access files via URL, but limited in that it canâ€™t navigate complex folder structures.
